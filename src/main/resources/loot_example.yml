# In this example, when the chest using loot_table 'justaname' restocks, there is a guaranteed diamond pickaxe with silk 
# touch enchant, there is a 50% chance for: either a diamond/unbreakable wooden sword with up to 2 enchants (sharpness I-V, knockback I,
# or fire aspect II) OR an unbreakable wood sword with silk touch, and a 10% chance for: a 20 stack of mossy stone blocks.
# Further, section '3' is rolled 10 times, with a 10% chance of EITHER 1 diamond or 5 gold, but not both.  (And the
# diamond is 5 times more likely!) There is also a 10% chance for 20 cracked stone brick (as indicated in '4').
# An additional note, the numbers used as headings can be any number or word as long as they are not the key words
# such as chance, id, amount, damage, rolls, name, level, or enchant.  They should be unique headings though as if
# they are the same, errors may occur.

  1: # This is just one of the sections that will be included in the loot. The number is meaningless.

                # the weight is 5 times more than the chance of 1 in the below section.
